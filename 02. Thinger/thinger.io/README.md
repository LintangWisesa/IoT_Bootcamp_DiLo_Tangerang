The Arduino Client Library is an easy to use client library to connect your IoT devices to the [thinger.io](https://thinger.io "thinger.io IoT Cloud Platform") IoT platform. This is a library specifically designed for the Arduino IDE, so you can easily install it in your environment and start connecting your devices within minutes.

It supports multiple network interfaces like Ethernet, Wifi, and GSM. So you can use it in several devices like the following:

* Arduino + Ethernet
* Arduino + Wifi
* Arduino + Adafruit CC3000
* Arduino + ENC28J60
* Arduino Yun (With SSL/TLS)
* Arduino MKR1000 (With SSL/TLS)
* Arduino GSM1400 (MKRGSM) (With SSL/TLS)
* Arduino + GPRS Shield
* Arduino + TinyGSM library for GSM modems using GPRS (SIM800, SIM900, AI-THINKER A6, A6C, A7, Neoway M590)
* Arduino + ESP8266 as WiFi Modem via AT commands (using TinyGSM library)
* Any ESP8266 variant like NodeMCU (with SSL/TLS)
* Espressif ESP32 (With SSL/TLS)
* Texas Instruments CC3200
* SeeedStudio LinkIt ONE (Both GPRS and WiFi)

It requires modern Arduino IDE version, starting at 1.6.3.
